                   The capital of Kazakhstan, located in the heart of Eurasia, is quite young compared to the centuries-old history of many cities of our vast planet, but it is a city that combines the uniqueness of the embodiment of the dreams and prosperity of Kazakhstanis. This city has truly become the embodiment of Kazakhstan's aspirations for the future, a symbol and stimulus for the country's development.
                   Nur-Sultan is the capital of Kazakhstan and a modern city that is attractive for tourists and comfortable for residents and guests of the capital of Kazakhstan, with a favorable environment.
                   The choice in favor of Nur-Sultan was due to a number of decisive advantages: vast urban area, favorable geographic location - proximity to the main economic centers of the country, significant demographic potential, well-developed transport infrastructure and a relatively favorable environment.
                   The endless steppes of Akmola have long been the place where various civilizations and cultures met and intertwined. "Father of history" Herodotus in his writings mentioned the route through the Great Steppe (later known as the Great Silk Road), along which the caravans passed in these places.

                   The development of handicrafts and handicrafts, the flourishing of trade in cities, previously traditionally occupied exclusively with animal husbandry and agriculture, was facilitated by caravan routes through the Great Steppe.
                   Today Nur-Sultan is not only a large administrative center of Kazakhstan, located at the intersection of the country's main development networks. It is a leading city that sets the tone for the innovative development of Kazakhstan. A city that acts as a locomotive of transformations in Kazakhstan of the new millennium. Tourist gem in the steppes.
